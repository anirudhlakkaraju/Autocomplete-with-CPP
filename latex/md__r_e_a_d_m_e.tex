Our project is to implement Auto Suggest using trie data structure. Our application targets coding text editiors. Many text editors, especially web browser editors, like Jdoodle do not have fast autocomplete.

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_trie}{Trie}} is a tree data structure which is used to store a key (a string). The main advantage of trie is efficient searching done in O(length\+\_\+of\+\_\+key) which is very fast compared to naive search where we check every word in the dictionary for a match. Using a preloaded dictionary, the algorithm can suggest words and improve the suggestions by storing words that were frequently selected by user in an L\+FU cache. The code works for all words, but we\textquotesingle{}re loading C++ syntax words in our test cases.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsubsection{Sample Test Cases}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
Please follow procedure as explained. There is no concrete output, as it is more of an interactive code. The working will be explained properly in the viva.

The code performs the following operations. The index will select the corresponding operation.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Load dictionary -\/ Allows user to load desired dictionary into \mbox{\hyperlink{class_trie}{Trie}} object. First line requires size of dictionary (n). Next n lines are the words to be loaded. ~\newline

\item Entry Field -\/ To enter prefixes. ~\newline

\item Check the L\+FU cache -\/ Allows user to check the cache contents. ~\newline

\item Exit -\/Terminate loop.

 Select \char`\"{}make\+\_\+pair\char`\"{} using the index.

 Notice that the previously selected suggestion is on top now. Select \char`\"{}make\+\_\+tuple\char`\"{} using the index.

2 ~\newline
 ma ~\newline
 Notice that \char`\"{}make\+\_\+tuple\char`\"{} is ranked above \char`\"{}make\+\_\+pair\char`\"{}, even though the latter is lexicographically smaller. This is because if multiple words share the max frequency, the cache return the most recently used word.

The cache can be checked anytime for frequency of usage (Operation 3).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{I\+N\+P\+UT}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
